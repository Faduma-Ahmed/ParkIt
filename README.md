# ParkIt
## About
Have you ever been stuck in a parking lot exit after an event, and paid more for your ticket than expected? Well, this is where we introduce ParkIT. The iOS app plays off the idea of AmazonGO with fast, efficient payments. There will be no parking attendants, no printed dashboard tickets, and no extensive lines at the exit. Just park and go. Fast, Cashless, Parking. Whether it is an indoor or outdoor parking lot, the iOS application does all the work for you. One will be able to locate the closest parking lot through the use of Google Geo Location API. With this feature, it identifies the Flat Rate and Regular Rates on the date of action. The back-end of the application was created on Heroku and Firebase, whereas the front-end design was performed on Swift and Sketch to fit the clean and sharp vision for ParkIT.
